This sample webview app illustrates the use of some common core Cordova APIs
and, where possible, the equivalent HTML5 APIs within a hybrid mobile HTML5 app.
This app has been built and installed on Crosswalk for Android, Android, iOS
and Windows 8 devices. It may run on other Cordova platforms, but has not been
tested on those other platforms.

A detailed "how to debug" using this app and the [Intel XDK][1] is provided in
the [included tutorial][]. Please read the tutorial for an introduction to this
sample app and debugging Cordova apps with the Intel XDK.

# NOTE:

Please ignore the `config.xml` file, the Cordova CLI `config.xml` format has
been changing significantly, especially with the release of CLI 5.0, and this
`config.xml` file has not been updated to reflect those changes. It will not
work as written. It was originally created for use with PhoneGap CLI and has
not been updated for use with the current PhoneGap CLI system, either.
